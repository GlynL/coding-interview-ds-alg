# Arrays
* static array
  - to add to array you need to copy it to new memory location
* dynamic array
  - expands when added to
  - memory taken care of by machine
* string questions normally want to use `str.split()` to convert it to an array first then tackle it

## good

* fast lookups
* fast push/pop
* order

## bad
* slow inserts
* slow deletes
* fixed size (if using static array) -- not js
