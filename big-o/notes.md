# Types

- O(n) - linear time
- O(1) - constant time
- O(n^2) - quadratic time
- O(n!) - factorial time - shouldn't encounter (worst possible)
-

# Rules

1. worst case
2. remove constants
3. different terms for inputs
   - different items looped over fn(items, items2) = O(a + b)
4. drop non dominants
   - only count the worst/slowest one

# Scalable

- speed - time complexity
- memory - space complexity
  - usually a speed/memory tradeoff
- readable
